  <h1>🚴🏼‍♀️ Bikewatching</h1>
  <p>This project offers a dynamic visualization and analysis of bike transportation within the Boston and Cambridge area. It utilizes a base map displaying the road network and labeled neighborhoods, providing a familiar geographical context. Overlaid upon this map are green lines representing designated bike lanes, highlighting the existing infrastructure. Individual BlueBike stations are depicted as circles, with the size of each circle reflecting the volume of traffic at that station. Furthermore, the color of each circle indicates the dominant direction of traffic flow, whether it's primarily entering or leaving the station. The project incorporates two datasets from BlueBikes, encompassing approximately 260,000 individual rides from March 2024, to inform the analysis of bike traffic patterns.</p>
